802ec08a-2ad4-4e24-be62-7b6907f510ac,shire@dundas.wa.gov.au,Shire of Dundas,"<p>Mining Heritage </p>
<p>The Norseman that stands today was born from its mining history and the pioneers that brought it to our township. Norseman sits as a gateway community at the end of the Eyre Highway, the first major town after crossing the border between Western and South Australia. Situated within the Goldfields region, Norseman is surrounded by other towns in the “Golden Outback” such as Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie-Boulder as well as the contrasting coastal town of Esperance.</p>
<p>The history of Norseman stems from the exploration of the South Coast by Edward John Eyre during the 1840’s, and the initial surveying of Western Australia by JS Roe who named the “Dundas Hills” in 1848. Flash forward to the late 1870’s where the Southern Area of Australia was at last connected to the rest of its country upon the completion of the Overland Telegraph Line between Albany and Adelaide.</p>

<p><strong>The Golden Age</strong></p>
<p>Gold was Dundas’ and furthermore Norseman’s claim to fame, the commodity putting the once non-existent town on the map. Prospectors began searching around pastures of the Dundas Hills area during the 1890’s. In this year, Mr. Moir of “Fanny’s Creek” found traces of alluvial gold. He ceased exploration until two years later when returning with a prospecting team, no gold was found. During this same time, other prospectors had begun to explore the area. In 1882, Messrs Mawson and Kirkpatrick discovered gold in the southern end of the field, naming it “May Bell”. Soon after this a rich outcrop of ore was discovered by Messrs Bromely, Mawson and Desjarlis. The following year, in August 1893 the “Dundas Field” was proclaimed, a catalyst for the establishment of the Dundas townsite after another two rich outcrops were discovered and registered under the name “Scotia”.</p>
<p>Laurie Sinclair immigrated to Australia with his family in 1863 from the Shetland Island. He worked closely with the Dempster brothers (whom were the original pioneers of Esperance). After an unsuccessful visit to the Coolgardie goldfield in 1893 Sinclair was returning to Esperance via Dundas. Here he located George and Jack Allsop whom were prospecting out from Dundas. Investigating a few specks of alluvial gold in a small gully, Sinclair joined the men on their prospecting endeavor. It was here that Laurie Sinclair discovered a rich gold reef which would be known to be “Norseman”.</p>
<p>Popular legend has it that after tethering his horse ‘Hardy Norseman’ up for the night Sinclair was surprised to discover that his horse had exposed a reef upon his return. Nonetheless the reef was registered by the men on the 13<sup>th</sup> of August 1894, the same day as a separate gold reef “Mount Barker” was registered by Messrs Ramsay, Talbot and Goodliffe.</p>
<p><strong>Early Day Norseman</strong></p>
<p>Norseman struggled to establish itself during its first few years as Dundas was the major township in the area, both areas approximately 4 miles apart. However due the Norseman fields being richer than those in Dundas it gradually outgrew the latter, and in 1895 was declared a town, followed by its declaration as a Municipality the following year.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://www.dundas.wa.gov.au/Profiles/dundas/Assets/ClientData/Images/Gallery/Norseman_GM%28568%29_scaled.jpg"" width=""259"" height=""192""></figure>

<p>The year 1895 saw the first Post Office, Bank and Doctor arrive in town. The Doctor operating in a tent for a hospital. The first Newspaper was also printed in October of this year and followed in January by “The Norseman Pioneer”.  The two joined together in 1899 and came out as “The Norseman Times” which circulated bi-weekly. By 1899 there were three churches, sporting facilities, five hotels and a carriage mail service known by “Cobb and Co Coaches”.</p>
<p>Water was supplied to the town by condensing lake water derived from the surrounding salt lakes. Water was also drawn from surrounding rocks situated north, west and east of the town until 1899 when a reservoir was constructed.</p>
<p>In 1901 a brewery and two general stores were built followed by another brewery in the next year. 1902 saw further infrastructure improve the town such as a dam, two new town halls and ten miles worth of watermains to carry water to parts of the town.</p>
<p>This increase in services within the town came from the booming of the Mines that sat within Norseman. The hand hauling method of extracting ore from the ground was replaced by a steam hauling plant. Between 1901 and 1903 gold was discovered five miles north of town, establishing a new town known as “Princess Royal” causing the Norseman population to slightly decline. This town however was abandoned during the 1920’s.</p>
<p>Norseman was linked to Coolgardie by railway in 1909, however the track did not continue to Esperance. Coaches were used to travel the 200 kilometre distance between Norsman and Esperance. The railway was completed in its entirety in 1929.</p>
<p>A theatre and telephone line were introduced in the 1910 period in addition to golf links and a racecourse being constructed. However, around this time the production of gold was decreasing rapidly due to the war and overworking of the reefs that had brought Norseman their prosperity resulting in the closure of majority of the major mines, causing the population to drop dramatically to 300 by 1920.</p>
<p>A group of local prospectors was formed to find a new gold reef, and in 1926 the ""butterfly"" was discovered, and the Butterfly Mining Company formed. In 1935 Western Mining came to Norseman which began a new era for the town. Money was put into improving the town and by 1936 the pipeline from Coolgardie was continued to Norseman. The company also gave the town electricity and with the backing of the company the Roads Board began work on footpaths and roads.</p>
<p><strong>Today</strong></p>
<p>The Norseman you look around and see today while different still holds the same spirit of the founders that made it what it is. The town today has one IGA, two petrol stations and multiple accommodation options. The Shire of Dundas’ population sits at 581 people as of 2016.</p>

12e42d6b-375b-420a-a768-a54395dc581a,hr@flinders.qld.gov.au,Flinders Shire Council,"<h2>General Vacancies Information</h2>
<p>Council has an obligation to hire people based on the principle of merit, meaning that a vacant position is offered to the person who demonstrates that they have the most relevant experience, skills, knowledge, and qualifications in relation to the job. This process promotes fair hiring of people, in that the job is offered to the “best person for the job” rather than a particular person because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traits such as ethnic background, age, religious background, and gender. Such traits have no bearing on how suitable a person is for the position and cannot be considered during the selection process. A candidate merely has to be fit to perform the duties of the role (e.g. age/gender is only an issue if the pre-employment medical shows that the person cannot safely perform the requirements of the role);</li>
<li>Whether they are friends or relatives of current Council employees. Simply being a friend or relative of a Council employee should not give someone an unfair advantage during the employment process.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fill a vacancy, Council will advertise internally (open to existing employees only), or externally (open to existing employees as well as members of the public). Internal advertising generally occurs where Council is confident that there is the interest and capacity to fill the vacancy with a current employee who has the appropriate skills etc. Human Resources coordinates but works closely with Management during the recruitment and selection process. For instance, in the case of Labourer/Plant Operator/Truck Driver positions, the applications are summarised by Human Resources and forwarded to Engineering Management for their consideration and review. Management and Human Resources then meet to arrive at a short-list of candidates to investigate further (e.g. by speaking with the applicant or conducting their Referee Checks). Interviews and a minimum of 2 satisfactory work-related Referee Checks must occur before a preferred candidate can be selected, and often specific tests (e.g. truck driving/plant operator competency; computer competency) are also conducted. Once Management and Human Resources arrive at a preferred candidate, a recommendation of appointment is made to the Chief Executive Officer, and Human Resources coordinates the appointment process from there (e.g. pre-employment medical, provision of relevant qualifications by the candidate to Council, letter of offer sent by Council).</p>
<h2>Traineeship And Apprenticeship Information</h2>
<p>In August/September of recent years, Flinders Shire Council has appointed the Townsville-based apprenticeship and traineeship agency, TORGAS, to recruit and select trainees and apprentices to be hosted by Flinders Shire Council. Council is keen to offer traineeships and apprenticeships as these provide employment and skill development opportunities for youth particularly, which they otherwise might not get locally. Because job appointments are generally made on the principle of merit, traineeships and apprenticeships can be a great way for people to obtain experience in a work environment where they might otherwise lack the skills, experience, qualifications and knowledge necessary to make the short-list for vacancies.</p>
<p>Of course, the trainee/apprentice also learns great skills from trained and qualified supervisors, and they obtain a qualification at the end of their course which might be used to obtain employment and successful career at Flinders Shire Council or another organisation.</p>
<p>In recent years, approximately 10% of Council’s workforce has consisted of trainees and apprentices (including school-based), which is an impressive percentage. In 2011 alone, four people who had successfully completed their traineeships/apprenticeships that year obtained employment with Council. In September 2012, Council advertised for a school based Business Administration trainee, a full-time Business Administration trainee, a Carpentry apprentice and a Mechanic/Diesel Fitting apprentice.</p>
<p>So... if you’d like to learn a trade skill such as carpentry, plumbing or diesel fitting, or if you want qualifications in business or civil construction... keep an eye out each year around August – October for TORGAS’s advertising for placements at Flinders Shire Council. </p>
<h2>Work Experience Information</h2>
<p>Flinders Shire Council is happy to support the Hughenden State School’s requests for work experience. In recent years there have been very productive for both the work experience student and Council.

<p>The name “Yilgarn” is aboriginal for “white stone” or “quartz”.</p>
<p>Southern Cross is the major town centre of the Shire of Yilgarn and is 370km east of Perth along the Great Eastern Highway. Other townsites in the Shire include Bodallin, Bullfinch, Ghooli, Koolyanobbing, Marvel Loch, Moorine Rock and Yellowdine.</p>
<p>The town of Southern Cross owes a lot to the discovery of gold and to Tom Riseley and Mick Toomey, who named the area after the Southern Cross , the constellation they used to help them navigate their way when travelling at night. Southern Cross literally boomed overnight.</p>
<p>The two major industries in the area are Mining and Rural. Gold, gypsum, salt and iron are mined, while grain, wool, sheep, cattle and pigs are the focus of the rural industry.</p>
<p>The co-existence of mining and agriculture has balanced the Yilgarn economy, with the two activities supplementing and complementing each other through their respective boom and bust cycles.</p>
<p>Tourism is another growing industry in the Yilgarn. There are many wonderful places of attraction throughout the Shire including Baladjie Rock, Frog Rock, Karalee Dam, Hunts Soak, Yilgarn History Museum, just to name a few. The wildflower season is an excellent time to visit the Yilgarn to see the may beautiful colours of the area. To learn more about what to see and do in the Yilgarn, visit our <a href=""http://visit.yilgarn.wa.gov.au/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Visit Yilgarn</a> page.<br><br>The people and places make the Yilgarn a place to remember. The long history surrounding the Shire is famous to many throughout the State and complements the existing beauty and adventure of the Shire of Yilgarn.

<p>Prior to European settlement, the first inhabitants of the Inverell district were members of the Kamilaroi (Gomeroi) and Anaiwan (Eneewin) nation. With many tribes making up each nation, traditional dialects spoken include Gamilaraay, Yuwalaraay and Yuwalayaay (Kamilaroi nation) and Nganyaywana (Anaiwan nation). Local placenames adopted from these dialects include Delungra, Bukkulla, Nullamanna, Wallangra and Goonoowigall.</p>
<p>Early European settlers in the 1850s originally founded Inverell as a small town to support agriculture, mainly grazing, discovery of tin then diamonds saw Inverell become the centre for mining tin, diamonds, lead and silver. The town and surrounding villages such as Elsmore and Tingha grew rapidly to support the mining industry and workers flocked to the district with the hope of striking it rich.</p>
<p>By the 1950’s, Inverell had become the largest producer of sapphires in the world and this led to Inverell becoming known as the Sapphire City.

<p><strong>Where Doomadgee has come from</strong> Our people have inhabited these lands for thousands of years. Many of our residents are Traditional Owners of the lands in this region. The traditional homelands of The Gangalidda and the Waanyi people lie in and around the Doomadgee Shire. There are also Garrawa and Yunjulla people and a range of people from Indigenous nations across Australia have made Doomadgee their home. The original Mission, known as ‘Old Doomadgee’ was established in 1931 close to the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Following a cyclone the mission was moved to its current site on the Nicholson River in 1936. In 1983 the Queensland Government assumed responsibility for the administration and management of the then Doomadgee Mission. In 1984 the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984 was enacted which established the Doomadgee Aboriginal Community Council which operated for 26 years. In July 2010 under the Local Government Act 2009 the Doomadgee Aboriginal Shire Council was established. The Council is represented by a Mayor and 4 Councillors who are elected every 4 years. <strong>Doomadgee Today</strong> Covering an area of 186,300 hectares Doomadgee is a Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT) Community. Doomadgee is approximately 100kms North West of Burketown and 130kms East of the Northern Territory Border. It is 630kms by road to Mt Isa and 1035 kms west of Cairns. Our Population is 1289 (667 Males 51.7%, 622 Females 48.3%) based on the 2011 Census. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 91.9% of the population. Some key statistical indicators of our community are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The median weekly personal income for people aged 15 years and older in Doomadgee is $280 compared with the State which is $587</li>
<li>Our unemployment rate is usually more than 10% above the State average and is currently above 19%</li>
<li>The average number of residents living in each of our houses is 5. The State average of number of people per house is 2.6</li>
<li>We have a very young community. The median age in Doomadgee is 22 years and Children aged between 0-14 made up 38.1% of the population and people aged 65 and older made up only 2.9% of the population.</li>
<li>29.4% of people were attending an education institution. Of these 64.8% were in Primary</li>

<h2>Living and Working in the Shire Of Menzies – Applying for Employment</h2>
<p>Steeped in rich history, Menzies and the surrounding communities are packed full of hidden gems. For the adventurous (or adventurous at heart) the opportunity to live and work in the Menzies shire opens a door to many a lifestyle and career experience and opportunities that are unique to the golden outback.</p>
<p>Taking your career regional offers development opportunities and career acceleration that just can’t be achieved in metropolitan local government organisations.</p>
<p>As a small organisation, Office based employees can expect to gain exposure to all facets of the inner workings of local government, not to mention building the business acumen required to lay the foundations for future leadership roles.</p>
<p>When it comes to building your knowledge, capability and understanding of the machinations of government, small regional shires offer exposure to unparalleled learning opportunities.</p>
<p>Works based employees work across the Shire maintaining infrastructure, camping destinations and airstrips. These roles will have you close to nature; red dirt underfoot and the crisp Goldfields blue skies touching the horizon.</p>
<p>Of course, embracing the career move does come with its challenges. With the population of Menzies town site and pastoral surrounds at 108 people (2016 Census data) and a further 150 people (approximately) residing in the Tjuntjuntjarra Community near the South Australian border our community amenities and services are limited.</p>
<p>A Community Nurse is stationed here three days a week with the Flying Doctor visiting monthly. Leonora (100 kms north) is home to the closest pharmacy, but medications can be ordered and delivered via the Community Resource Centre (CRC) or purchased in Kalgoorlie which is located 130 kms south.</p>
<p>We are a small town with a primary school, Post Office/ Visitor Centre/ Community Resource Centre; Caravan Park; Art Centre; Café and a Hotel that carries some basic essentials. Leisure time can be spent at the water park; tennis and basketball courts; Youth Centre; a developing Senior Citizens Centre or exploring the walking trails surrounding town.</p>
<p>Weekends are for taking advantage of the spectacular scenery within the region and there is a reason why the golden outback is referred to as road trip country.</p>
<p>Take a day trip to Lake Ballad to view Inside Australia - Antony Gormley Sculptures. Set over 10 square kilometres the 51 sculptures represent the residents of Menzies whose bodies were scanned for casts. The art installation forms part of the Golden Quest Discovery Trail which takes in the ghost towns and historic sites north of Kalgoorlie. But perhaps Lake Ballad is at its most spectacular when the sun sets and the absence of light pollution enables amazing star gazing opportunities surrounded by the eerie shadows of the sculptures.</p>
<p>Niagara Dam & Kookynie, located to the north of Menzies is a popular weekend destination with its iconic pub and township ruins to explore. With a population of just 13, visitors can call into the Grand Hotel Kookynie for a cold drink, hot meal and history.</p>
<p>Kalgoorlie is our closest major regional centre, and the hub of the region, located 130 kms to the south. Kalgoorlie is home to major supermarkets, national retail chains, cosmopolitan pubs, restaurants and cafes. Perth is a short 1 hour flight from Kalgoorlie for those trips to the city.</p>

<p><strong>Corporate Logo</strong> </p>
<p>The logo represents a stylised classical Japanese pagoda that symbolises the enduring ties between Cowra and Japan. These ties began with the internment of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war at Cowra during World War II and the tragic Cowra breakout in August 1944. The repetitious uneven line work of the logo; refined in shape and colour; represents that art of calligraphy and also symbolise canola crops in bloom; pastures and the waterways of the Lachlan River and Wyangala Dam; and the wings of an eagle.

Our geographical positioning also means that we share an international border, which we manage via treaty with Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>We have four distinctive types of islands within our region:</p>

dd3b09e0-e99c-4e0d-a5a3-b62fddf87e4f,recruitment@eastpilbara.wa.gov.au,Shire of East Pilbara,"<p>The Shire of East Pilbara is the largest Shire in the Australia covering approximately 372,571 square kilometres; larger than the state of Victoria. Driving will take 2 days to cross from east to west and 6 hours from north to south.</p>
<p>It's main town sites are Newman, Marble Bar and Nullagine, with a number of Aboriginal Communities namely Jigalong, Punmu and Parngurr, lrrungadgi and Parnpajina.</p>
<p>The Shire of East Pilbara's administrative centre is located in Newman.</p>
<p>Nullagine is Newman's nearest neighbour being 192 kilometres away, along the Marble Bar Road. If prospecting is your passion then the Shire of East Pilbara, being rich in minerals, is a great destination. Nullagine was the site of Australia 's first diamond discovery and was a thriving town during the gold rush period of the 1880's. Remnants of that bygone era are still evident in the region.</p>
<p>The Marble Bar Road is predominantly gravelled for the 303 kilometres between Marble Bar and Newman. Marble Bar has the reputation of being Australia's hottest town. Marble Bar is the gateway to explore areas such as Coppin's gap, Kitty's Gap as well as  Doolena and Carrowine Gorges.</p>
<p>In the centre of the Shire is <strong>Karlamilyi National Park.</strong></p>
<p>The karlamilyi National Park, rich in aboriginal culture and with an abundance of wildlife, is 1,283,706 hectares; is the largest national park in Western Australia and one of the largest in the world. It is also one of the most remote places in the world. The park is 420 kilometres south-east of Marble Bar and 260 kilometres from Newman.</p>
<p>At the northern most point of the Shire is the pristine coastal area of Cape Keraudren (Croy-don). This 4,800 hectare reserve offers breathtaking coastal views as well as fabulous crabbing and fishing. A must see for the day tripper or camper.</p>
<p>The Canning Stock Route, a favourite among serious 4wd travellers, has approximately 500km's of its track running through the Shire.</p>
<p>The Shire is abundant in plants and wildlife and offers some of the best night sky viewing platforms in the country. Indigenous artwork in its original state is dotted throughout the shire providing an array of opportunities for the adventurer or day tripper.</p>
<p>Wet season (October to April) sees a transformation of the landscape with many of the rivers, creeks and swimming holes providing great recreational destinations.</p>
<p>The mining sector dominates the Shire of East Pilbara economic landscape. Mining is estimated to contribute $16.017 billion (89%) of total output generated within the Shire. BHP iron ore mine, Mount Whaleback, located in Newman is the largest open cut iron ore mine in the world.</p>
<p>Our towns have survived fluctuations of fortune for more than a century. Resourcefulness and resilience, along with planning, will hold them in good stead throughout the 22nd century. The energy of our people will ensure that the heart of the Pilbara will beat on, and will beat strong.</p>
<p>The Shire of East Pilbara is not just about resources - it's also about resourcefulness.</p>

ee2d0904-90d5-4ae4-97e5-2fa561ec8e62,mail@ngaanyatjarraku.wa.gov.au,Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku,"<p>The Shire is part of the Goldfields-Esperance region and is one of the nine regions of Western Australia. It is located in the south-eastern corner of Western Australia, and comprises the local government areas of Coolgardie, Kambalda, Dundas, Esperance, Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Laverton, Leonora, Menzies, Ngaanyatjarraku and Ravensthorpe.</p>
<p>The Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku is part of the Goldfields Esperance Regional Collaborative Group (""GERCG"") which is made up of ten shires across the region, with an approximate population of 60,000 residents and covering an area of 770,488 square kilometres, which is just under a third of the total land mass of Western Australia.</p>
<p>The mining and processing of mineral resources is the primary industry within the region, complemented by the subsequent commercial services. The region also has a strong agricultural industry, as well as a focus on tourism particularly in the southern parts of the region.</p>
<p>The Shire encompasses an area of 159,948 square kilometres and is located approximately 1542km from Perth. The region itself is diverse in natural beauty from the magnificent Rawlinson ranges to the red sandy plains of the Gibson Desert.</p>
<p>The Shire is a unique local government in that its community of interest is contained with the traditional lands of the Ngaanyatjarra people of the Central Desert of Western Australia. The 99 year leases held by the Ngaanyatjarra Land Council on behalf of the traditional owners also form the boundaries of the Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku.</p>
<p>The Shire’s main township is Warburton, which is also the largest of the 11 Indigenous communities within the Shire. Warburton is positioned 1,542kms north-east of Perth, 560kms of gravel road north-east of Laverton, 750kms north-east of Kalgoorlie and 1,050kms south-west of Alice Springs. Neighbouring shires include the Shire of Wiluna, Laverton, and East Pilbara. The Shire offices are located in the Tjulyuru Cultural and Civic Centre in Warburton.</p>
<p>In the 2011 Census the Shire had an estimated residential population of 1,437 people, comprised of 49% male and 51% female residents and there are approximately 509 residential dwellings within the Shire. The Shire has a higher percentage of residents aged between 0-29 years and a lower proportion of residents aged 65+ years compared with the wider Australian population. This must be a consideration for the Shire when considering the types of service provision to the community. </p>
<p>The distinctive red sand and blue skies of the area form a spectacular context for a diverse range of desert flora and fauna. Rocky escarpments and other landforms give texture to this beautiful desert country.</p>

bf21decd-4e00-4478-a78f-a3f9c68ca79d,ceo@sandstone.wa.gov.au,Shire of Sandstone,"<p>Sandstone is located 742 km north east of Perth via the Great Northern Highway and the town of Mount Magnet.</p>
<p>The Shire lies in the heart of the spectacular east Murchison District and its bronzed landscape tells many tales of bygone days when gold was first discovered. In 1894 Ernest Shillington and a number of fellow prospectors found gold about 20 km southwest of the present town site.</p>
<p>For a period of six years from 1907 Sandstone was a small city of some 6,000 to 8,000 people. It had four hotels, four butchers, many cafes, stores and business houses, as well as a staffed police station and two banks. During this boom period, in July 1910, the railway came to the town. However by 1919 only 200 people remained and many buildings were pulled down and moved. Fortunately Sandstone was able to survive as a centre for the region’s growing pastoral industry. In more recent times, gold-mining has re-emerged as Sandstone's principal industry.</p>
<p>Throughout the Sandstone area natural rock formations or breakaways contrast dramatically with the rust stained sandstone landscape which gives the town its name. The mainly flat surroundings of Sandstone and the distant horizons give the impression of a very large sky which provides that wide open and free feeling which one can only experience in the outback.</p>
<p>Sandstone is home to Australian wildlife such as emus, bungarras and of course kangaroos. Indeed it is not unusual to see a kangaroo hopping in the main street after dark.</p>
<p>The red terrain and the vivid blue of the mostly cloudless sky, enhances the natural beauty of this unique place. Sandstone is a wonderful, peaceful environment to experience the glory of the night skies. In the evenings you can witness the truly spectacular sunsets that Sandstone has to offer. At night, far from the interference of city lights, the darkness of the outback makes Sandstone a great setting for stargazing and viewing the magnificent sky of the southern hemisphere. Sandstone also boasts a spectacular wildflower display with July to September seeing the landscape transformed from red earth to a carpet of magnificent wildflower colours.</p>",08 9963 5802,https://www.sandstone.wa.gov.au/,https://www.councildirect.com.au/uploads/employer/logo/447421/Sandstone.png,,,UTg0PZeNWKs,"Sandstone Western Australia 6639, Australia",,Sandstone,Western Australia,6639,Australia,2020-04-20 02:29:12 UTC,2

The Shire encompasses a diverse landscape that is both picturesque and productive and is approximately 560 km north of Sydney, 160 km north of Tamworth along the Fossickers Way and 85 km north-west of Inverell. The shire is 9,122 square kilometres in size and is situated north of Tamworth Regional Council and continues almost to the Queensland border.</p>
<p>The southern boundary of the shire is the Nandewar Range where the Gwydir and Namoi Valleys meet. The Horton Valley and Cobbadah District are home to some Australia’s most highly regarded beef cattle studs. These enterprising farmers use the latest artificial breeding and agronomic technology to produce beef of exceptional quality. Meat Sheep and merinos that grow high quality wool are also grazed in this area.</p>
<p>The Gwydir River enters the Gwydir Shire where it spills from the Copeton Dam and meanders in a westerly direction through the towns of Bingara and Gravesend. The Gwydir valley is well know for irrigated and dry land cropping as well as livestock production. In addition to the traditional crops of wheat, barley, oats and sorghum, there are olive groves, pecan nut plantations and freshwater fish farms in the Gravesend district.</p>
<p>Heading northwest from the timbered surrounds of the town of Warialda and the close-knit community of Coolatai, the countryside opens into an undulating vista of basalt farmland. This part of the Shire which include the villages of Crooble, Croppa Creek and North Star, is known as the ‘Golden Triangle’. Farmers using advanced farming techniques, such as minimum tillage and satellite guidance systems, produce a variety of high yielding crops such as wheat, barley sorghum, maize, chick peas, canola and cotton to name just a few. This area also has several cattle feed lots which supply grain fed beef to the Australian domestic market and export markets throughout the world.</p>
<p>Both Warialda and Bingara have Hospitals, Aged Care Hostels, Medical Centres, Caravan Parks, Swimming Pools, Pre-schools, Libraries, Tourist Information Centres, and a Mobile Pre-school based at North Star. Warialda is the centre for the Council’s Technical Services functions. Bingara is the centre for the Administrative functions. The two centres are being linked through the use of sophisticated communications equipment to ensure that the amalgamations primary objective is achieved which is to save the existing employment numbers within each of the main urban centres of Warialda and Bingara.</p>

<p>Bellingen Shire is located on the Mid North Coast of NSW halfway between Sydney and Brisbane and just south of Coffs Harbour. It has a total area of 1,605 square kilometres with a coastline of approximately 10km. The region is renowned for its ecological diversity with State Forests and National Parks covering over 53% of the local government area. The resident population of the Shire was 13,450 in 2010. Over the past ten years the population of Bellingen Shire has increased at an average annual rate of 0.9%. </p>
<p>The shire consists of three broad topographical areas incorporating the seaboard around Mylestom, Repton and Urunga, the valleys of the Bellinger and Kalang rivers and the Dorrigo plateau landscapes. Each has its own characteristics and provides a choice in cultural and natural diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>The Shire is a lifestyle region with an emphasis on cultural vibrancy, liveability and social cohesion. It has diverged over the years and is now a mix of traditional and non-traditional farming. Many of today's residents are artists, craftspeople, writers, musicians and horticulturalists, with approximately 12.1% of employed residents having established home-based activities.</p>
<p>Bellingen Shire is an ""economy in transition."" While the traditional industry base of timber, dairying, potato and meat processing are essential to the economic health of the Shire, emerging and developing industries include tourism which is underpinned by the Dorrigo Rainforest Centre, national parks, cultural attractions and a successful events sector. Aquaculture, agribusiness/processing, arts and cultural industries, organics and regional cuisine and aged care have also developed.</p>
<p>The events sector is also part of this ""creative"" economy. The renowned annual Camp Creative, Dorrigo Folk & Bluegrass Festival, Bellingen Music Festival, Bellingen Readers and Writers Festival all add to the Shire's already buzzing cultural life. The vibrant monthly Bellingen Markets also provides an opportunity to showcase our people and culture.</p>
<p>Tourism is strengthened by the fantastic climate, a stunning environment, café, market and festival culture and access to a wide range of tourism and recreational opportunities. For lifestyle you can choose the Dorrigo plateau, rural areas, town convenience or beachside living.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.wentworth.nsw.gov.au/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wentworth</a> is considered the gateway to Outback NSW, and is situated on the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers in southwestern New South Wales. Mildura, situated on the Victorian side of the Murray, is the nearest commercial centre of any size. Mildura and Wentworth are also marketed under the banner of ""Murray Outback"" and ""Sunraysia"".</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.wentworth.nsw.gov.au/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wentworth Shire </a>is a region of great diversity and it offers you the opportunity to experience an introduction to Outback Australia.<br>The area can be an arid and harsh landscape or a landscape that is soft and serene in solitude. It is a land of rivers, creeks and lagoons; of windmills, bores and waterholes. There are miles and miles of saltbush, acacia, casuarina and mallee, wide flat plains, drifting desert sands, red roads and cobalt blue skies.</p>
<p>Magnificent ancient eucalyptus trees that are regal, gnarled and twisted, plentiful wildflowers, kangaroos of grey, blue or red, eagles, hawks, parrots and the beautiful little azure blue finches all make up the unique landscape of this exciting region.<br>Wentworth Shire covers an area of 2,616,926 hectares (26,000 sq km) and has a population of approximately 8,000 people. The southern boundary (along the Murray River) has the greatest population density in the townships of Wentworth, Dareton, Buronga and Gol Gol. Wentworth is situated 1,075 km from Sydney, 585 km from Melbourne and 420 km from Adelaide and is located within New South Wales, on the border of Victoria.</p>

<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Shire of Morawa covers just over 350,000 hectares (3,528 km²) consisting of agricultural and pastoral land, mining leases, Crown land, reserves and townsites.</p>
<p>The area of remnant vegetation in the Shire equates to 22,224 hectares of private land, 54,007 hectares of public land and 15,825 hectares of private land modified for grazing purposes.</p>
<p>Our region is renowned for a diversity of flora that is seldom equalled, with this being attributed to the diversity of landform and soil types that are present within the district. In the Shire of Morawa you will see everything from large flat plains, to rolling hills and rugged breakaway country. Approximately 12,800 hectares of land in the Shire is salt affected land or salt lakes.</p>
<p>Soil types are primarily York Gum soil (light/heavy) interspersed with Salmon Gum clay. The light land soils are yellowish brown sands or clayey sands, normally 1 metre in depth overlying laterite or gravel. Numerous hydrological surveys have been conducted over recent years.</p>
<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>Morawa experiences warm to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The climactic conditions can be described as being semi-arid with hot and dry summers. Summer temperatures can average around the 40° celsius or 104 degrees fahrenheit mark. Morawa tends to experience and mild to cool, slightly wetter winters. Rainfall is mainly during the winter and spring months with total average rainfall being reported at approximately 337 mm per year.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The economy of the district is firmly based on cereal and legume crops and wool. For a short time during the late 1960's and early 1970's, iron ore was mined at Koolanooka Hills. In 2006 mining recommenced at Koolanooka Hills giving our Shire a great economic boost.</p>
<h2>The name ‘Morawa’</h2>
<p>Morawa is an Aboriginal name, first shown on maps of the area for a rock hole in 1910. It is possibly derived from ""Morowa"" or ""Morowar"", the Dalgite, a small marsupial which burrows into the earth. A Dalgite is a type of bilby. Another possible meaning is ""the place where men are made"". This is probably a reference to initiation ceremonies conducted in the area by the Aboriginal inhabitants.</p>", (08) 9971 1204,https://www.morawa.wa.gov.au/home.aspx,https://www.councildirect.com.au/uploads/employer/logo/394743/morawa_logo_transparent_background.png,,,olVlMoxGyg8,"Morawa WA 6623, Australia"," 26 Winfield Street, ","",Western Australia,6623,Australia,2020-02-18 04:27:55 UTC,6

<p>The Shire of Dungog is part of the Hunter Region and the Lower Hunter Sub-Region and is bound by Great Lakes Shire to the East, Singleton Shire to the West, Scone Shire to the North-west, Gloucester Shire to the North and by Port Stephens Shire and the City of Maitland to the South.</p>
<h5>Geography</h5>
<p>Dungog Shire covers an area of 2248 sq Kilometres. The Council is situated in the Barrington tops region and has a population of 8,500. The Shire consists predominantly of very rugged to hilly country which becomes less rugged from north to south. The major population centres within the Shire include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dungog</li>
<li>Gresford</li>
<li>Paterson</li>
<li>Vacy</li>
<li>Martins Creek</li>
<li>Clarence Town</li>
</ul>
<h5>Rivers</h5>
<p>The Shire has two principal rivers, the Williams in the east of the Shire and the Paterson in the west. Both are tributaries of the Hunter, and both traverse the Shire in a general north-west to south-east direction. The Williams and Paterson Rivers drain from the Barrington Plateau and contribute over 40% of the flow of the Hunter. Lostock Dam was constructed on the Paterson River in the 1970's to regulate flow and prevent lack of water in drought.</p>
<h5>Climate</h5>
<p>The climate of the Shire is varable, with temperatures ranging from 0-15 degrees Celsius in the winter months to 25-42 degrees Celsius during summer. The Shire is prone to protracted periods of dry weather, particularly in summer. Rainfall, particularly in the south of the Shire, is variable and largely affected by coastal weather patterns. Rainfall in the north of the Shire is influenced by the mountainous terrain. The average rainfall in the Barrington Tops area is 2500mm, with the average in the south of the Shire being 900-1000mm. In the mountainous far north of the Shire the climate is at times sub-alpine with snow not uncommon during the winter months.</p>
<h5>National Parks and State Forests</h5>
<p>Barrington Tops National Parks covers an area of 62,448 hectares, rising to over 1580 metres above sea level. The Barrington Tops is part of the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserve of Australia (CERRA) which is listed as a World Heritage site. 85% of the Barrington Tops National Park is declared wilderness. Approximately one fifth of the National Park is located within the borders of the Dungog Shire, at its northernmost end.</p>
<p>The Chichester State Forest is included in the southern end of the Barrington Tops National Park. Two thirds of the Chichester State Forest is located within the boundaries of Dungog Shire. In the Shire's south portions of the Uffington and Wallaroo State Forests are located within the boundaries of Dungog Shire, close to its southernmost border. The Allyn and Paterson State Forests are located in the north of the Shire in the upper reaches of the Allyn Valley.<br><br><em>Extract from Dungog Shire Council's Community Profile of Dungog Local Government Area 1999.</em><br></p>

Meston recommended their segregation from the European population, protecting them from alcohol and opium and providing better medical attention and ‘instruction in industrial habits’. His report resulted in the passage of the <em>Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act</em> by the colonial legislature in 1897.</p><p>A Salvation Army officer at Nanango, William Thompson, secured the severance of 7000 acres from the Barambah pastoral station in 1901. The allotment was gazetted as a mission station and known as the Barambah Industrial School. Its establishment predated the beginnings of Murgon township by three years. Thompson gathered local Aborigines onto the mission station and was superintendent until 1904. Conditions were rudimentary, worsened by drought and lack of finance. Control of Barambah passed to the state government in 1905, but the superintendent allowed Aboriginal residents to be forcibly hired out for casual labour in the rapidly growing local agricultural economy. Despite this, the settlement became substantially self-sufficient in food (goats, poultry, vegetables), a hospital was built and a sawmill opened in 1917. Improved housing was built with locally milled timber.</p><p>In 1919 the world-wide influenza epidemic swept through Barambah, worsening the health of a population suffering high incidences of hookworm, heart disease and tuberculosis. Twenty percent of the population of 600 died in 1919 according to one report.</p><p>Barambah was the receiving place for Aborigines swept up by government policy from the South Burnett and elsewhere. An informed source estimated in 1935 that there were 28 ‘tribal’ groups present.</p><p>During the 1920s a larger school and a new hospital were opened. The reserve was also enlarged to nearly 32,000 acres in 1932. In that year the name was changed to Cherbourg, the name given to one of the ten blocks that had comprised the Barambah pastoral station. Conditions remained poor. Children lived in segregated dormitories. They were often short of bedding and subject to punishment for minor infringements.</p><p>Despite the merging of so many Aboriginal groups, a Barambah/Cherbourg identity emerged. The Barambah cricket team (1922) was district champion in the 1931-32 season and consecutively from 1933-39. Its most famous player, Eddie Gilbert, played for Queensland and bowled Don Bradman for a duck in an interstate match in 1931. Twenty-nine Cherbourg men enlisted to serve in World War I, and 19 in World War II.</p><p>In 1944 a piggery was added to Cherbourg’s dairy. Conditions improved in the postwar years – a new recreation hall opened in 1948 and a new hospital in 1958 – but the most significant improvement was the payment of award wages in the 1960s. In 1966 the first Cherbourg Community Council was elected, and in 1986 it took over local management of the community from the state under a Deed of Trust. Cherbourg is the most southern of the Aboriginal Local Government Areas. A supermarket/general store was built in 1976, again from locally milled timber. Later facilities included an aged persons’ home (1991), a redeveloped hospital and a TAFE (both 1993) and a hostel/motel. In addition to these facilities Cherbourg is also home to The Ration Shed Museum, Barambah Pottery, a joinery works, farm, a sporting complex, football oval, recreation reserves. A handsome memorial commemorates the war service of locals, and the Blair Theatre at the TAFE commemorates the town’s famous singer, Harold Blair. Maroochy Barambah (formerly Yvette Isaacs, of Cherbourg) is a celebrated rock singer.</p><p>The Wakka Wakka people issued a native title claim to lands including the Cherbourg Aboriginal Community in 2012 with the Federal Court.</p><p>The town was briefly isolated by floodwater in February 2013.</p>

<p>The first European explorer into the Narembeen area was Surveyor General J. S. Roe who, on 11 October 1836, camped near a rocky outcrop which, because he had seen emus the day before, he named Emu Hill.</p>
<p>In the 1850s a small number of European settlers moved into the area. When the explorer Henry Maxwell Lefroy travelled through the area in 1863 he visited Charles Smith who had settled near Emu Hill, naming his 60,000 acre (about 24, 300 ha) property Narimbeen.</p>
<p>The only other Europeans in the area at this time were the tenacious sandalwood cutters who passed through looking for the precious wood.</p>
<p>The whole area was sparsely populated until the beginning of the twentieth century when land was opened up and farmers moved in to graze sheep and grow wheat on their small 1000 acre (about 405 ha) holdings. The area around Emu Hill and Narembeen was surveyed in 1910.</p>
<p>As late as 1917 the township of Narembeen did not exist and even in 1920, after the arrival of the railway line, it was nothing more than a siding for Emu Hill.</p>
<p>Between 1920 and 1922 the importance of the two sidings reversed. In 1920 Emu Hill was the largest centre but the local community, when confronted with the possibility of building a hotel, opposed the plan and suggested a coffee palace or temperance hotel.</p>
<p>The idea of creating a town at the Narembeen siding was the brainchild of a prominent Perth lawyer, Henry Hale, and a Perth publican, Paddy Connolly. When the men realised the problems that were being created by the teetotal community at Emu Hill they purchased 30 acres (about 12 ha) of land at Narembeen, used their influence with the local politicians, got permission to build a pub and then sold off the rest of the land to prospective residents of their ‘private town’. Although local government was established and administered by a Road Board in Narembeen in 1924, the private town status was not rescinded until 1968.</p>
<p>The pub, which still stands today, was all that was needed to overwhelm the struggling nearby settlements and become the centre for the whole area. By 1925 Narembeen had a population of 2100.</p>
<p>In 2010, Narembeen celebrated 100 years of agricultural settlement.</p>
<p>The Narembeen Historical Society does a fantastic job at recording and preserving the history of the pioneers of Narembeen.</p>

7e27957d-71da-41ae-9be1-aea38663ab5c,recruitment@swek.wa.gov.au,Shire of Wyndham - East Kimberley,"<p><strong>The Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley is located in the ruggedly picturesque and sparsely populated northeast corner of Western Australia (WA), stretching from the Northern Territory border to the northern most tip of WA.</strong></p>
<p>The Shire covers an area of 121,000 square kilometres and is one of four local governments that make up the Kimberley region. The Shire includes the towns of Kununurra and Wyndham and there are also a number of Aboriginal Communities; the largest being Kalumburu, which is situated in the northern part of the Shire.</p>
<p>The Shire boasts many attractions some of which include Carboyd Ranges, Celebrity Tree Park, Cockburn Ranges, Drysdale River National Park, Emma Gorge, Five Rivers Lookout (the Bastion), Gibb River Road, The Grotto, Ivanhoe Crossing, Kelly’s Knob, Kununurra Diversion Dam/Lake Kununurra, Lake Argyle, Lily Lagoons, Mirima National Park, Mitchell River National Park, Ord River Irrigation Area, Ord River, Parry’s Lagoon Nature Reserve, Pentecost River, Ragged Range, Wyndham Community Fishing Jetty and Zebedee Springs.</p>
<p>Many significant events occur in the Shire including the Ord Valley Muster, Lake Argyle Swim, Kununurra Agricultural Show, Kimberley Writers Festival, Kununurra Rodeo, Kununurra and Wyndham Races, and Dam-Dam Dingy Dash.</p>
<p>The Shire is currently experiencing a period of growth relating to the Ord East Kimberley Expansion project.</p>
<p>With its tropical climate and its many natural attractions, the Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley is the eastern gateway to the Kimberley.</p>
<h2><figure><img src=""https://www.swek.wa.gov.au/Profiles/swek/Assets/ClientData/SWEK_Map.png"" width=""579"" height=""331""></figure></h2>
<h2>Kununurra</h2>
<p>Kununurra was developed in the early 1960s to service the construction of the Ord Irrigation Scheme. The town has seen the transformation of ancient river plains into one of Australia’s most diverse and productive agricultural areas. Harnessing the mighty Ord River opened up the area to horticulture, agriculture, aquaculture and eco-tourism.</p>
<p>From its beginnings as a service town for workers, Kununurra has grown to a population of about 7000 people and is home to most of the Shire’s residents and town services.</p>
<h2>Wyndham</h2>
<p>Wyndham is Western Australia's most northern town and the second largest town in the Shire. It is a small town with a population of just 1000, but Wyndham was once a bustling town, with the arrival of news of gold discoveries at Halls Creek.</p>
<p>The Wyndham Port was first established at the base of the Bastion in the 1880's and today provides for the state ship service, the import of fuel, ammonium nitrate and general freight and the export of iron ore, nickel and live cattle. It is also a popular stop over for cruise ships.</p>
<p>Wyndham, like Kununurra, is surrounded by cliff and gorge country and has five rivers flowing into the Cambridge Gulf. The Cambridge Gulf is a massive waterway providing access to recreational mariners and commercial fishing operators with entry points into five rivers, being the Pentecost, Forrest, King, Durack and Ord Rivers as well as numerous creeks.</p>
<h2>Aboriginal Communities</h2>
<p>The Shire is home to around 40 small indigenous communities which includes Kalumburu and Doon Doon. During the wet season (October to May) many community residents move to the larger towns to be closer to family members when flooding can isolate their communities from services.</p>", (08) 9168 4100,https://www.swek.wa.gov.au/,https://www.councildirect.com.au/uploads/employer/logo/370375/Wyndham_-_East_Kimberley.png,,,/4Z5K-iQ4Cx8,"Kununurra WA, Australia",20 Coolibah Drive,Kununurra,Western Australia,"",Australia,2020-01-09 15:22:35 UTC,3

Land throughout the Yass Valley was settled relatively early due to its location on the road to Port Phillip (Melbourne), as well as the quality of rural land.</p><p>The early fortunes of the Yass Valley were influenced by the success of agriculture – notably the Fine Wool industry and the Main Southern Railway line as well as Hume Highway passing through.</p><p>Yass Valley was literally born ‘off the sheep’s back’ and while agriculture has been the backbone of our community we are seeing new and innovative businesses standing up and being recognised nationally and internationally.</p><p>Sharing a border with our Nation’s Capital, Yass Valley residents have unique work and education opportunities whilst living in a rural environment.

<h1>Our Shire</h1>
<p>Mansfield’s picturesque Shire is only a 2.5 hour drive north of Melbourne. The landscape is dominated by the Great Dividing Range and includes the Alpine resorts of Mt. Buller and Mt. Stirling. Natural environment features within Mansfield Shire are the Alpine National Park and Australia’s second largest inland waterway – Lake Eildon. Mansfield Shire boasts major river systems, lakes, mountains, vast tracts of what is referred to as ‘High Country’, and broad, productive valleys where agriculture and rural living integrate. With Mansfield Shire being a nationally recognised icon location, our municipality is in high demand for recreation and lifestyle activities.</p>
<p>The major urban centre of our Shire is Mansfield and there are numerous outlying communities scattered across the municipality. Each of these townships have a strong sense of community and not only celebrate the place in which they live, but they also have their own history, distinct character and sense of identity.<br></p>
<h2>Population growth</h2>
<p>Our Shire has been recognised as one of the fastest growing municipalities for more than a decade, with a population growth of around 2% each year since 2001. The combination of lifestyle and proximity to Melbourne has seen the permanent population grow from 6,631 in 2001 to 8,605 in 2016. The Shire’s population growth is accelerating due to in-migration mainly from metro Melbourne, going up by 299 people in 2020 alone.<br></p>
<h2>Our Economy</h2>
<p>We have a strong economy, with agriculture being one of the Shire’s key economic drivers, contributing $60.7m to our economy. Cattle and sheep grazing, along with seed production, are major industries within the Shire. Grape and tomato production are also significant as are many agriculture related service industries. In 2019/20, the total tourism and hospitality sales in Mansfield Shire was $74.7m, the total value added was $36.6 million.</p>
<p>It is estimated that Mansfield Shire has 1311 businesses, an employment base of 3,829 and an industry output of $457m. The Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing industry had the largest number of total registered businesses in Mansfield Shire (299), comprising 22.8% of all total registered businesses, compared to 5.9% in Victoria.</p>

The land is crossed by songlines and trading paths stretching from the coasts to the deserts, some passing near the modern town.</p><p>The story of that long occupation remains alive today and it is revealed in the culture of the Jaru, Kija, Kukatja, Walmajarri, Gooniyandi and other indigenous people who live in the Shire of Halls Creek.</p><p>That ancient world changed late in the 1800's with the arrival of Europeans, searching for minerals for wealth and land for cattle. On Christmas Day 1885 prospector Charlie Hall found a huge 28-ounce (nearly 1 kilogram) gold nugget at a site that would eventually be named after him.</p><p>News of the discovery drew more than 15,000 people to what is now Old Halls Creek to try their luck. It proved an inhospitable land for these people and the graves of some can be found in Old Town's small cemetery.</p><p>The gold rush lasted less than three months and Halls Creek became a trading centre for cattle stations, aboriginal communities and miners who stayed in the area. The post office with its telegraph line that terminated here, the police station, government office, racecourse and stores gave the town a purpose.</p><p>In 1918 the Australian Inland Mission built a hospital and the old town struggled on, short of inhabitants and water. In 1948 an airfield was built near the site of the present town and over the next decade the old town moved nearer to this new site. Except for the police station, which finally relocated in 1961, the old town was abandoned by 1954.</p><p>The new town of Halls Creek is one of the largest predominantly indigenous communities in Australia. It is a friendly, welcoming place and offers travellers an ideal stop on their journeys. The old town is worth a visit, nestled in spectacular country.</p><strong>General Employment Applications</strong><p></p>

f6e4da52-4115-4180-a72f-d44584d4b61b,council@richmondvalley.nsw.gov.au,Richmond Valley Council,"<p><strong>Richmond Valley Council was formed in February 2000 as a result of the amalgamation of the former Casino Council and Richmond River Shire Council.</strong></p>
<p>The area of around 3050 square kilometres has a total population of 23,000 and is growing at a rate of 0.4% per year (State average 1.2%).</p>
<p>The traditional custodians of the land of the Casino area, or Djanangmum as it is known to Aboriginal people, are Galibal. The wider area known today as the Northern Rivers was occupied by the Bundjalung-speaking peoples, made up of an estimated 20 different language groups.</p>
<p>Pastoral settlement in the Richmond Valley began in the 1840s, more than a decade after the Richmond River had first been entered from the sea by Captain Henry Rous. By the end of the 1840s, most of the valley had been occupied by large pastoral holdings under government leases. The town of Casino was the main entry point into the Richmond Valley for overland travellers; it was the district’s front door.</p>
<p>On 30 April 1879 a public meeting held in the School of Arts building in Casino began the process of forming a municipality. Following a petition of 76 ratepayers, elections were held 22 March 1880 and Messrs Simpson, Gulley, Jordan, Grouch, Vesper and Carlill were returned as alderman. From these men, the first mayor was chosen as Frederick Burgess Gulley, the owner of the largest store in Casino. Gulley would be mayor eight times, spanning his 17 years as an alderman for Casino. Their first challenges were many: streets were rudimentary and boggy and rubbish was dumped in the streets; and no drainage existed in the flood-prone area and trade focussed on delivery of goods via the river leading the provision of infrastructure to become a priority for the thriving township.</p>
<p>In 1890 the first Casino Town Hall was built and in 1900 a drainage plan submitted by the State Government’s Department of Works was adopted, despite an economic depression putting curbs on Council spending.</p>
<p>Progress was slow for Casino’s water supply and street lighting with 1906 seeing the advent of water works, with another four years of debate and negotiation with suppliers before Casino would see sewerage works begin and 11 years before 12 gas lights were installed in the CBD area of the town, supplied by Casino’s own gas works. In 1916, the first sale yards were opened in the heart of town.</p>
<p>Through further economic depression, the First World War and battles with plague and influenza, the Council emerged in the 1930s with a new town hall building and augmentation to its water plant to supply the burgeoning population. The new Civic Hall opened 1937 before war again curtailed government spending. Following World War II, Casino celebrated the opening of a library service in 1945, the aerodrome in 1947 and the Casino War Memorial Olympic Pool in 1952.</p>
<p>The year 1954 was marked with a royal visit from Queen Elizabeth and by a record flood which washed away the Irving Bridge. The third Irving Bridge was opened in 1959. A time of prosperity into the 1960s and 1970s saw the building of the new Casino High School, expansion of residential areas to encompass North Casino and western Casino and the first popularly elected Mayor, JCD Lane in 1977.</p>
<p>In 1980 Casino celebrated 100 years in local government with an extensive procession and an official dinner attended by Premier Neville Wran. In 1982, the first year Beef Week was celebrated, Council held a referendum to decide the method of election of mayors. In 1983 the saleyards opened at its current location of Nammoona and the Jabiru Geneebeinga wetlands was opened in 1988.</p>
<p>In 1994 Council opened the Casino Visitor Information Centre and became sole trustee of the showground. In 1997, Casino officially became a sister city to Cassino, Italy.</p>
<p>The end of 133 years of Casino Council began with the merging of Tomki Shire Council with Woodburn in 1976 to become the Richmond River Shire Council, which amalgamated with the Municipality of Casino into the Richmond Valley Council in February 2000.</p>
<p>These unions recognised not only the social, economic and historical connections between each local government area, but also highlighted the importance of the Richmond River in linking the communities</p>",(02) 6660 0300,https://richmondvalley.nsw.gov.au,https://www.councildirect.com.au/uploads/employer/logo/301720/Richmond_Valley_Council.png,https://www.councildirect.com.au/uploads/employer/hero/301720/Richmond_Valley_Council.jpg,,,"Casino NSW 2470, Australia",,"","",2470,Australia,2019-10-21 04:00:52 UTC,261

<p>There are, however, major shifts occurring in agriculture with the introduction of new farming methods and diversification of many land holdings toward new ventures such as olive growing, alpaca wool and horse studs.  Furthermore, Upper Lachlan Shire is becoming a popular destination for retirees and people wishing to leave large cities for a lifestyle change.  The economic base of the Shire is also changing, with tourism becoming the third major industry in the Shire, behind the traditional agricultural industries and retail.</p><p></p>

71ea357a-a97e-493b-889a-80cac1ac5a63,hobart@councildirect.com.au,City of Hobart,"<p>The 1850s saw the introduction of responsible government in Tasmania and the establishment of municipal administration, in the form of a general purpose locally-elected Council.</p>
<p>A court of fifteen commissioners was created by the <em>Hobart Town Commissioners Act 1846</em>, with the commissioners responsible for such things as paving and lighting throughout the city.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the Commissioners was held on 29 September 1846, but disputes soon began to arise between the colonial and civic authorities on the apportioning of revenues. Within a year the body of Commissioners was dissolved.</p>
<p>Municipal government was established by the <em>Hobart Town and Launceston Municipal Council Act 1852</em>. During this year the first elections for a seven-member council were held. The new council took office from the beginning of 1853, with William Carter as Mayor.</p>
<p>In 1857 the Municipal Council was incorporated (<em>Hobart Town Corporation Act 1857</em>), and its constitution and powers redefined.</p>
<p>Between 1853 and 1934 the Council was led by various mayors, elected annually. The title was raised to ‘Lord Mayor’ by Letters Patent issued by King George V in January 1934.</p>
